# ENGR101_2020 AVC Project

### Team Members:
- Deepkrsna Arora (aroradeep-DK) ~ aroradeep@myvuw.ac.nz
- Selby Dasent (McCoy-Flateline) ~ dasentselb@myvuw.ac.nz
- Elliot Rose (jesusonweels) ~ roseelli@myvuw.ac.nz
- Ella Tait (ellatait07) ~ taitella@myvuw.ac.nz

### Roles:
- Deepkrsna Arora & Selby Dasent: Programming the image processor
- Elliot Rose & Ella Tait: Programming the robot's movement

## Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to write software which guides a robot through a maze. The robot is equipped with a video camera and two wheels. The camera image is an input for the program. The program controls the speeds of left and right motors.

## Communication tool:
- Facebook messenger

### GitHub:
- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/McCoy-Flateline/ENGR101)
